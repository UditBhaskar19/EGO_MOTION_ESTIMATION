# EGO_MOTION_ESTIMATION
Here the ego-motion estimation is performed from the **wheel speeds** and **steering angle**. It is assumed that the **vehicle is car-like with 4 wheels is a 2-Wheeled Drive**.The results are validated using **NuScenes** mini dataset.

## Table of Contents

#### [P1 - Detecting Lane Lines (basic)](project_1_lane_finding_basic)
 - **Summary:** Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used OpencV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision
 
#### [P2 - Traffic Sign Classification](project_2_traffic_sign_classifier)
 - **Summary:** Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.
 - **Keywords:** Deep Learning, TensorFlow, Computer Vision
