# EGO_MOTION_ESTIMATION
This repository contains **design** and **implementation** of ego-motion estimation techniques for different sensor types and various sensor combinations. These techniques and the concepts used in these techniques can be used in various domains like **robotic perception**, **autonomous driving** and **advance driver assistance system applications**. These are ongoing projects, and several other ego-motion estimation techniques might be added and the existing ones might be enhanced in the future. Its my sincere hope that the community finds these useful :)

## Projects

#### P1 - Ego-motion estimation from wheel speeds and steering angle
#### P2 - Ego-motion estimation from radar sensors ( raw radar measurements that are in polar )
#### P3 - Ego-motion estimation from radar sensors ( filtered radar measurements that are in cartesian )
